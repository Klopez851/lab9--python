# Your Card class should have an attribute for suite, name, and point value (Heart, K, 10) and methods to
# set the point value and show the card. (suite + name). Your Card class should calculate its own point value based on
# the name (‘2’,’8’,’K’,‘A’). Your Deck initialization method should create the deck list of card objects. Your Deck
# class should import your Card class, and have a single attribute of deck which is a list of 52 card objects. Your
# Deck class should implement methods to shuffle the deck, show the deck, draw a card object from the deck
# (which should remove it from the deck), and show the count of cards remaining in the deck. Write a driver test p
# rogram with a main() function to instantiate your Deck class and test each of the methods. When you draw a card from
# the deck object, place it in a list that you might consider naming “hand”.
